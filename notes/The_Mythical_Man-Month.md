## Chapter 1. The Tar Pit

> (...) Therefore let us begin by identifying the craft of system programming and the joys and woes inherent in it.

### The Joys of the Craft

> (...) Fourth is the joy of always learning, (...)

### The Woes of the Craft

> (...) This then is programming, both a tar pit in which many efforts have floundered and a creative activity with joys and woes all its own.

> (...) This complex craft will demand our continual development of the discipline, our learning to compose in larger units, our best use of new tools, our best adaptation of proven engineering management methods, liberal application of common sense, and a God-given humility to recognize our fallibility and limitations.
