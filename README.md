# *“What is (not) Software Crafting?”*

Hi, I'm the living repository provided as companion material to the talk *“What is (not) Software Crafting?”*, so far delivered at:

- *[Clean Code Days](https://www.cleancode-days.de/agenda-english/talks/articles/m34-what-is-software-as-a-craft-12697.html)* @ Munich (June 20th, 2018)
- *[AsturiasHacking](https://www.meetup.com/AsturiasHacking/events/244424657/)* @ *El Manglar (Cultural Center)* in Oviedo, Spain (November 7th, 2017).
- *[Ruby User Group Berlin](http://www.rug-b.de/topics/what-is-not-software-crafsmanship-541)* @ *solarisBank* (September 7th, 2017).

## Abstract

“What do we mean by Software *Crafting* or Software as a Craft? What not? How and why was it born? By the way, wasn't it called Craftsmanship? Anyway: why does it matter?

After answering all these questions and introducing concepts like *deliberate practice* and *Open Space Technology*, we will explore the current status of Software Crafting communities and events across Europe.”

## Resources

### Inclusive language: from craftsmanship to crafting/craft/crafters/as a craft

This amazing e-mail by Alastair Smith speaks by itself:

[Gist: Changes to the Cambridge Software Craftsmanship Community](https://gist.github.com/alastairs/f00d1b81bfacbaddb064ecb9748cfd94)

Please, use inclusive language :-)

### Note

On February, 2018, [@rachelcarmena](https://github.com/rachelcarmena) released [“Silent talk: Software as a Craft”](https://codurance.com/videos/2018-02-23-software-as-a-craft/). Awesome work, completely recommended.

### Software Crafting History

[Blog: Software Crafting Week: A brief history](http://www.shino.de/2010/05/14/software-craftsmanship-week-a-brief-history/), by Markus Gärtner.

[Web: eXtreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org)

[Web: Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

[Web: Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/)

#### Related historical discussions on what is it & why does it matter

I find super useful the work by Markus Gärtner (again). You can find his attempt at defining craftsmanship here:

[Blog: Was ist Software Craftsmanship?](http://www.mgaertne.de/2011/11/was-ist-software-craftsmanship/), by Markus Gärtner (German)

The movement generated tons of discussions, e.g.:

[Blog: Programming is not a craft](https://dannorth.net/2011/01/11/programming-is-not-a-craft/), by Dan North.

This was the reply from Adewale Oshineye:

[Blog: Software Craftsmanship: More than just a manifesto](http://blog.oshineye.com/2011/01/software-craftsmanship-more-than-just.html), by Adewale Oshineye.

Michael Feathers wanted us to focus on the thing:

[Blog: The Thing of Software Development](http://michaelfeathers.typepad.com/michael_feathers_blog/2011/01/the-thing-of-software-development.html), by Michael Feathers.

Martin Fowler did a decent job summarizing (part of) the whole debate and providing his point of view:

[Blog / Bliki: CraftmanshipAndTheCrevasse](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CraftmanshipAndTheCrevasse.html), by Martin Fowler.

Robert C. Martin thinks Fowler's fears are groundless:

[Blog: Bringing Balance to the Force](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2011/01/19/individuals-and-interactions.html)

Finally, the following blogpost series by Duncan Smith elaborates on what is software crafting, by giving his opinion on different definitions out there. The first part can be found here:

[Blog: Is Software Craftsmanship some code-obsessed mishmash of martial arts and carpentry?](http://itsadeliverything.com/is-software-craftsmanship-some-code-obsessed-mishmash-of-martial-arts-and-carpentry), by Duncan Smith.
